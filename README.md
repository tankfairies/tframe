# TFrame
A simple MVC framework with available Curl and SQLite and caching wrappers.

This small project is to show how a model - view - controller architecture can be built.

As well as the MVC component there is also a config manager, sqlite db handler and an api curl hanlder.

## Installation

To setup it up run: -

`git clone https://github.com/tankfairies/tframe.git`

I runs fine on Homestead (https://github.com/laravel/homestead).
